# What is CQRS?

## Command Query Responsibility Segregation

  - two separate models:
     - **Command** (or **Write**) model
     - **Query** (or **Read**) model

???

@Renato: 
I splitted 1 slide to 3 slides

---

class: left, top
# What is CQRS? (write side)

  - the write side **receives commands**

  - commands represent **an intention** that
     - may be **rejected** (resulting in some kind of **failure**)
     - may be **accepted** (**publishing** zero or more **events**)

  - events represent **what has happened**
     - *zero events*: nothing happened
     - *one or more events*: one or more things have happened

???

Commands are written in the imperative tense 
`CreateOrder`, `AddItem`, `CancelOrder`, etc.

Events are written in the past tense.
`OrderWasCreated`, `ItemWasAdded`, `OrderWasCancelled`, etc.

---

class: left, top
# What is CQRS? (read side)

  - the read side **subscribes** to **events** and reacts upon event **notifications**
     - it can react in whatever way it wants
     - typically, it **generates views**

???

@Renato: 
I have tried to stay close to the vocabulary of the standard java reactive org pub/sub api

# What is ES?

## Event Sourcing

  - Records each event in an **Event Log** (a.k.a. **(Event) Journal**)
     - The event log is **append-only**
     - The event log is the **single source of truth**

---

layout: false

# What is CQRS/ES?

  - ES is very often used in **combination** with CQRS

  - this combination, a.k.a. **CQRS/ES**, is a very powerful paradigm

  - CQRS/ES allows for **Asynchronous** CQRS

     - results in an efficient/scalable write model
        - avoids any write contention

     - supports multiple read models
        - using different storage mechanisms
        - using different data from write model
      

???

1. naive async: cron-job that reads the write-model and generates read-model. Very inefficient and write-model must have all data that read-model needs.
2. sync: write-model and read-model together in same tx. What we do when we have many read-models? Over different storages? Contention not solved.
3. async: event sourcing - event journal

---

# What is an Aggregate?

  - It's a **Domain Driven Design** concept, related to a **Consistency Boundary**

  - An aggregate somehow represents the **history** of all past events
     - think of it as an **accumulated result** of somehow **traversing** all past events, while **applying** them to an **accumulator** 

  - An aggregate somehow decides if a command is rejected or accepted (publishing zero or more events)
     - think of it as a **guardian** of a consistency boundary

  - It is the *command side* that guarantees that the consistency boundary is respected
     - the write-model is responsible for consistency
     - the read-model simply consumes the consistent event log

# Big Picture

# Fun.CQRS

- It's a **minimal framework** for CQRS/ES in **Scala**

- It tries to implement an **Opiniated Functional Foundation** for CQRS/ES

- It offers a **concise use-site API**

- As of today, it has two **backend** implementations:
   - **InMemoryBackend** (tests) and **AkkaBackend**

- It is based on **interpreters** of higher kinded types `F[_]` 
  - more on that soon

---

# Actions and Projections

- `Actions`
  - define how `Command`'s are rejected or handled
  - define how `Event`'s are handled
  - are used to define the `Behavior` of an `Aggregate`

- `Projection`'s
  - are used to do whatever you want with persisted `Event`'s

---

# Command Handlers and Interpreters

- `CommandHandler`'s may return:
  - zero or more (i.e. one or many) `Events`'s
  - unboxed (`Identity`) or boxed (in a `Future`, `Try` or `Option`)
  - other types (like `Validation`) can be plugged in as well

- The `Backend` defines the final effect `F[_]`
  - for the `InMemoryBackend`, `F` is `Identity`
  - for the `AkkaBackend`, `F` is `Future`

- The `Interpreter` transforms the `CommandHandler`'s return type to `F[_]`

???

This is also a good opportunity to talk about `Identity`

TODO: add slide with code fragments of `eventually.OneEvent`, `attempt.OneEvent`, `maybe.ManyEvents`, etc
Back to the basis, a `Command` can fail, an `Event` is always applied.

# Code Fragment (accepted command)

```scala
    actions
      .commandHandler {
        OneEvent {
          case SomeCommand => 
            SomeEvent(someEventArgs)
        }
      }
      .commandHandler {
        eventually.ManyEvents {
          case OtherCommand(someCommandArgs) =>
            Future.successful(
              List(
                FirstEvent(firstEventArgs),
                SecondEvent(secondEventArgs)
              )
            )
        }
      }

```

#Step 1

  Implement 'creation actions' and 'EmptyOrder' behavior

  ###`EmptyOrder`
  First state once we initialize the **Order Aggregate**. It has not items.

  - we call the 'creation actions' the **Command** and **Event Handlers** needed to
  bootstrap the **Aggregate** (open to Order.scala).

  - 'EmptyOrder' behavior must be implemented in `EmptyOrder.possibleActions`
    - Accepts AddItem and CancelOrder commands.
    - Requires interaction with the 'fake' `StockService`

???
It can be useful to code this first actions together with the studends.
Specially because of command handlers returning `Future`, ie: `eventually.OneEvent`

TODO: think about how to best start the hacking part. Should we do a first example with the students?
---

#Step 2

  ### `NonEmptyOrder`

  A non-empty order has at least one item.

  - Head to `NonEmptyOrder.possibleActions`

  - `AddItem` and `RemoveItem` items must interact with `StockService`

  - `CancelOrder` as well

  - `PayOrder` must interact with `BillingService`

  If all items are removed, `NonEmptyOrder` transition back to `EmptyOrder` state.

---

 #Step 3

  `PayedOrder` and `CancelledOrder` behavior

  `PayedOrder` and `CancelledOrder` cannot accept any new commands and therefore is considered to have reached its end-of-life.  How can we deal with that?

  tip: use `rejectCommand` method. Watch-out the kind of function it accepts!

---

#Step 4

  Up to now we have only worked on the **Command Side**.

  A **Projection** is basically a `PartialFunction[DomainEvent, Future[Unit]].`

  Often used to generate **Views**, but can also be used for intra **Aggregate** communication.

  Head to `OrderDetailsProjection`

---

#Step 5

  How to initialize an Order using the `AddItem` command?
  Can we emit a list of Events List(OrderWasCreated, ItemWasAdded) in the 'factory actions'?

  Let's break the tests and see how we can fix it.

  Pick one of the test and comment out the 'creation' commad.

  ```scala
  // orderRef ! CreateOrder
  ```
